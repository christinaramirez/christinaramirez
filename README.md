- ğŸ¤  Hey, I'm Christina! 
- ğŸ’» I'm seeking a full-time data scientist position!
- ğŸ”­ My Master's degree in data science from Northwestern will be complete in June 2024.
- ğŸ¤– My GitHub page is being updated to include my recent projects. (More coming soon!!)
- ğŸ˜¸ Fun fact: I'm a proud catlady and animal lover.
- âš¡ When I'm not data science-ing and petting cats, I love hand sewing and mending things!
